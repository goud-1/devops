 ansible setup
--------------
three servers

ansible set up

cd .ssh
ansible is used ssh configuration

so by using ssh configuration ansible master will communicate with slaves
ssh configuration steps:
step-1:
in master only master:
cd .ssh
ssh-keygen
press 'enter' button 4 times,then it will generate id_rsa and idrsa.pub files
cat id_rsa.pub
copy the content
step-2:
goto slave
cd .ssh
nano autherised_keys  
then remove the content up to ssh then add the content which is copied from master.
step-3:
------
hostname -i it will display private ip
then goto master give this like following
ssh private key of slave

ansible configuration:
----------------------
sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y

vim /etc/ansible/hosts

here we have to enter the private ip addresses of slave machines

ansible all -m ping--->this is used for to verify the ansible configuration

history:
yum update -y

    3  ls
    4  ssh-keygen
    5  ls
    6  cat id_rsa.pub
